## Environment setup
Hi Bing Chat, I'm working on a demo project that uses Weaviate, Oxigraph, LlamaIndex, LangChain, and Jupyter notebooks to create and query a knowledge graph. I'm using Docker, Docker Compose, and VSCode dev containers to manage the services and the development environment. I will be using nbdev and dvc. I need some help in getting the github repository setup configuring devcontainers and configuring devcontainers to use a docker-compose for the Oxigraph and Weaviate services. This is an experimentation repository to learn more about how to connect these technologies using linked data and semantic web technologies like rdflib. Can you assist me?
